# Microglia_scRNA-seq-classical-analysis-with-seurat
This is the classical script of analysis of single cell RNA seq data from one sample. Data were download from public GEO dataset, GSE133433.

The original dataset contain 4 samples, wt_male, wt_female, 5X_male, 5X_female. This depository only use the data of wt_male and 5X_male.

wt_male and 5X_male sample were first analyzed seperately here to show how consistent the data analysis would be.

Then analyzed together by the harmoney method to reduce batch effects.
